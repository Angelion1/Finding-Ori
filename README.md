Finding Ori and DnaA boxes in a genome using GC-Skew method

The origin of replication aka the Ori is a site in the genome where the replication of DNA begins. Ori has some k-mers which are called
DnaA boxes. These DnaA boxes are conceptually hidden messages which indicate binding sites for polymerases. So finding these DnaA boxes is
a very important task for biologists studying replication.

The repository has code for finding such DnaA boxes and also as examples has 3 genomes of which DnaA boxes are known experimentally and
have been used to test the code.
